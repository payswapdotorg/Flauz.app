# Project rules

## Flauz source of truth

Before implementation, read [Flauz Architecture & Implementation Constitution](docs/FLAUZ-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md), [Master Implementation Roadmap](docs/IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md), [Work Order Template / Execution Protocol](docs/WORK-ORDER-TEMPLATE.md), [Context/Harness Architecture](docs/CONTEXT-HARNESS-ARCHITECTURE.md), and [Product UX Journeys](docs/PRODUCT-UX-JOURNEYS.md). These documents define the product architecture, runtime context/harness contracts, UX discoverability requirements, and execution process. `docs/parity-matrix.md` is authoritative for Codex-specific parity only.

- Build a native Rust replacement for Codex Desktop. Do not add Electron, Tauri,
  Wry, WebView, Node.js, or browser-runtime dependencies.
- Treat stable `26.721.3996.0` as a behavioral reference, not a runtime
  dependency.
- Never modify the installed MSIX. Never open the live `CODEX_HOME` SQLite,
  JSONL, auth, or log files directly. Runtime access to the default
  `~/.codex` goes through a supervised official `codex app-server` process;
  development and tests use an isolated `CODEX_HOME`.
- Bound every external frame, event, log, queue, and history query. No
  unbounded `read_to_string`, JSONL line reads, or startup scans.
- Keep platform process management behind `codex-platform`. On Windows, prefer
  Job Objects and graceful cancellation; never implement polling `taskkill`
  loops.
- Keep codexRS-owned storage single-writer and paginated. Existing Codex data
  remains app-server-owned and is queried through bounded, paginated protocol
  methods (`thread/list` must set `useStateDbOnly`). Use snapshots for direct
  import, recovery, and fixtures; never share direct file access.
- Run `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`, and
  `cargo test --workspace` before handing off changes.

## Proportional Engineering

- Apply KISS, YAGNI, and the Pareto principle. Make the smallest maintainable
  change that satisfies the explicit acceptance criteria and current evidence;
  prefer existing patterns and code paths.
- Do not add speculative implementation. Approved Flauz architecture seams may
  be introduced only when the assigned work order explicitly requires them;
  do not build future clients/providers/orchestration early without a work order.
- Keep verification proportional. Add or update only the smallest focused tests
  needed to prove changed behavior or prevent a concrete observed regression.
  Do not add redundant unit/integration/E2E coverage, exhaustive edge-case
  matrices, broad regression suites, or unrelated test refactors unless the
  task, affected shared contract, or observed failure requires them.
- Keep security work proportional to the actual trust boundary and concrete
  threat model. Preserve mandatory safeguards and fix vulnerabilities
  introduced or exposed by the task, but do not add speculative hardening, new
  security frameworks, or unrelated defenses without evidence or an explicit
  requirement.
- Before expanding scope, identify the concrete acceptance criterion, failure,
  or risk that requires it. If none exists, omit the extra work. If expansion
  would materially change the solution, request owner direction first.
- These proportionality rules do not authorize skipping checks explicitly
  required by the selected router row, current repository contracts, or release
  gates applicable to the changed behavior.

## Universal Safety

- Integrity and safety checks are authorized only for the local repositories,
  owned runtime surfaces, and isolated fixtures named by the task. They are
  defensive validation; third-party systems, accounts, credentials, and data
  are out of scope.
- Never print, commit, move, copy into artifacts, or expose secrets, tokens,
  credentials, private keys, raw connection material, customer data, or
  unredacted provider payloads.
- Do not perform broad deletion, destructive Git operations, database resets,
  account deletion, production mutation, deploy, payment action, or external
  communication unless the task explicitly authorizes it and the required guard
  is satisfied.
- Preserve evidence, audit artifacts, archive history, rollback material, and
  generated provenance. Relabel unclear history; do not erase it during routine
  cleanup.
- Treat dirty files and other worktrees as concurrent work. Do not overwrite,
  revert, stage, or reformat changes outside the assigned scope.
- Keep cleanup targeted, reviewable, and reversible. Never use an automated
  cleanup `--apply` mode for repository-context work.


## Product discoverability

- A major capability is not product-complete merely because its backend or
  runtime path exists. Its assigned work order must map it to a journey in
  `docs/PRODUCT-UX-JOURNEYS.md`.
- Major capabilities require a normal visible entry point, a contextual
  affordance, a search/palette fallback, a useful empty state, and a
  success/next-step state where applicable.
- Do not hide reusable Procedures, context inspection, multi-environment
  execution, collaboration, evidence, or other platform primitives behind
  developer-only surfaces.
